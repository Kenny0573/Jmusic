<b>Hello! Thank you for inviting MarinaBot, a public instance of ShiverFork to your server!<br>
Before anything else, we just need to get a few things out of the way first, alright?<br>
Standard "Terms of Service" junk, ya' know? The invite link will be below it all.</b>

1. I do <b>NOT</b> own the rights to, nor do I claim to own the rights to, Splatoon, Shiver, Marina, or any other intellectual properties owned by Nintendo or otherwise. ~~Nintendo please don't take down this repo, I own none of your content.~~

2. I do not endorse usage of MarinaBot for anything against Discord's, (or any other platform's) ToS.

3. Do not report issues with MarinaBot/ShiverFork to [JMusicBot](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot)'s issue page. Please use the [ShiverFork issues page](https://github.com/lilliepad1/MusicBotShiverFork/issues) instead.

MarinaBot's code is open-source, and can be found [here!](https://github.com/lilliepad1/MusicBotShiverFork/tree/master) Feel free to look inside the code and see how it ticks!<br>
If you plan on checking out the code, it would be nice if you could give the project a star while you're at it! It helps out a ton!
## **Alright, now that you have totally read the Bot's Terms of Service, Feel free to invite the bot using [this link!](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1038906152181837935&permissions=103819584&integration_type=0&scope=bot)**
