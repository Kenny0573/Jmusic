<b>Hello! Thank you for inviting MarinaBot, a public instance of ShiverFork to your server!<br>
Before anything else, we just need to get a few things out of the way first, alright?<br>
Standard "Terms of Service" junk, ya' know? The invite link will be below it all.</b>

1. I do <b>NOT</b> own the rights to, nor do I claim to own the rights to, Splatoon, Shiver, Marina, or any other intellectual properties owned by Nintendo or otherwise. ~~Nintendo please don't take down this repo, I own none of your content.~~

2. Please don't use MarinaBot for anything against Discord's, (or any other platform's) ToS. I'm pretty sure I should say this just to cover my ass. 

3. Please do not bother [jagrosh](https://github.com/jagrosh), (the original creator of [JMusicBot](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot),) regarding <b>ANY</b> issues with ShiverFork. Please use the [ShiverFork issues page](https://github.com/lilliepad1/MusicBotShiverFork/issues) instead.

4. If you don't agree to the afformentioned terms, please <b>DO NOT</b> use the public MarinaBot, and host your own instance of ShiverFork instead. I can't ask anything of you when you host your own instance.

5. Finally, if you're going to use MarinaBot, it would be nice if you could give the ShiverFork project a star on Github. Please. It helps out way more than you know.

## **Alright, now that you have totally read the Bot's Terms of Service, Feel free to invite the bot using [this link!](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1038906152181837935&permissions=103819584&integration_type=0&scope=bot)**
